## 🎪 **Live Demo Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Stakeholder Presentation**
```
Audience: Investors, executives, non-technical stakeholders
Best Tool: HTML Prototype
Why: "This actually works" beats "this is how it would work"
Script: Demo full functionality, show real PDF export
```

### **Scenario 2: Design Review**
```
Audience: Designers, UX team, creative director
Best Tool: Figma
Why: Visual exploration, rapid iteration, design thinking
Script: Show design system, jam on new features live
```

### **Scenario 3: Developer Handoff**
```
Audience: Engineering team, technical leads
Best Tool: Both (Figma → HTML)
Why: Design specs + implementation reference
Script: Show Figma design, then HTML implementation
```

### **Scenario 4: User Testing**
```
Audience: End users, beta testers
Best Tool: HTML Prototype
Why: Real interactions provide genuine feedback
Script: Let users actually use the app
```

## 🛠️ **Recommended Workflow**

### **Phase 1: Exploration (Figma)**
```
Duration: 1-2 hours
Purpose: Rapid visual exploration
Process:
1. Brainstorm multiple approaches
2. Try different layouts quickly
3. Test color schemes and typography
4. Get team feedback and alignment
5. Pick winning direction
```

### **Phase 2: Validation (HTML)**
```
Duration: 4-8 hours  
Purpose: Technical validation and implementation
Process:
1. Build functional prototype
2. Test real interactions
3. Validate technical feasibility
4. Create developer reference
5. Demo to stakeholders
```

### **Phase 3: Production (React/Next.js)**
```
Duration: Variable
Purpose: Ship to users
Process:
1. Use HTML prototype as reference
2. Build production components
3. Integrate with backend systems
4. Optimize for performance
5. Deploy to users
```
