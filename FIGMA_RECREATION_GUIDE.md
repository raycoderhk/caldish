3. **Component duplication** (add new food cards)
4. **Text editing** (update copy quickly)
5. **State switching** (show different upload states)

### **Demo Flow Suggestions:**
```
1. Show current design recreation
2. Duplicate a section to try new layout
3. Change colors to show brand flexibility  
4. Add a new feature section (live jamming)
5. Show mobile responsive version
6. Demonstrate real-time collaboration
```

## ‚úÖ **Success Criteria**

- [ ] Recreate your HTML prototype in Figma
- [ ] Understand component vs instance concepts
- [ ] Use Auto Layout for responsive designs
- [ ] Create interactive prototypes
- [ ] Feel confident jamming on new UI ideas
- [ ] Demonstrate Figma during live presentations

## üéâ **Next Steps After Recreation**

1. **Share with teammate** for real-time collaboration test
2. **Try jamming** on a new feature together
3. **Create mobile app mockups** for future development
4. **Build design system** documentation
5. **Plan regular design jam sessions**
